  <h1>Phil1504: Language and Logic</h1>
  <h2> Professor Parent </h2>
  <p> Language and Logic is a course that teaches students to philosophically analyze
    and categorize types of arguments and therefore improve skills of reasoning.
  </p>
  <p> Professor Parent enjoys teaching classes in the philosophy Department
    always making the subject material interesting enough for everyone to be able
    to understand </p>
    <p> This class has definitely taught me how to analyze human argumentation
      and interaction at a deeper level. Despite the occasional intricacies of
      the problems, it overall gives a lot of valuable information.

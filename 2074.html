<h1>Comm 2074: Intro to Sports Media</h1>
<h2> Professor Roth </h2>
<p>Intro to sports media has been a very interesting class this semester as someone
that has always been very passionate about sports. This class focuses on the marketing,
advertising, and new communications jobs emerging through the sports world.From discussing
TV contracts in sports and the rising worldwide market of sports jobs, to projects
designed to test our creativity about new sports ventures this is definitely one
of the most interesting classes at Virginia Tech. </p>
<p> Professor Roth served as the voice of the Virginia Tech Hokies for several
decades and still works for ESPN as a sports broadcast reporter. His knowledge of
various sports is perfect for this course that has continually grown in popularity
since it was introduced at Virginia Tech. </p>
<p> I intend to pursue a concentration in sports analytics at Virginia Tech as part of
my Multi-Media Journalism major and I believe that this class is a great foundation
of knowledge about sports communication that will aid me in the coming semesters. </p>

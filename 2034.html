  <h1>COMM 2034: Visual Media</h1>
  <h2>Professor Evia</h2>
<p>Visual media is a fascinating course which has the purpose of teaching
professional commnunications practices to be utlizied in the outside world.
We have explored the creation and analysis of various media formats including
magazine spreads, high definition photographs, professional videography,
and website design. </p>
<p> Professor Evia has been teaching the Virginia Tech Communications Department
  for many years now. Living in Blacksburg with his family he enjoys his job
  teaching students everyday despite hating talking about them when they
not here. </p>
<p> I have had a good semester in the class learning a lot of valuable skills
  that I can take into the communications world after graduating.

     <h1>COMM 2034: Visual Media </h1>
     <h1> Dr. Carlos Evia </h1>

     <p> Visual media is a fascinating course which has the purpose of teaching professional communications practices to be utlizied in the outside world. We have explored the creation and analysis of various media formats including magazine spreads, high definition photographs, professional videography, and website design.
     Professor Evia has been teaching the Virginia Tech Communications Department for many years now. Living in Blacksburg with his family he enjoys his job teaching students everyday despite hating talking about them when they not here.
I have had a good semester in the class learning a lot of valuable skills that I can take into the communications world after graduating.

     <h1>GEOG 1014: World Regions </h1>
     <h1> Professor John Boyer </h1>
     <p> World regions is a fascinating class that takes an in depth look at world wide events over the last several centuries and how interactions in and between various nation's have helped shape the regions, cultures, and geopolitical moves in the modern day.
Professor Boyer has introduced this radical semi hybrid class over the last several years at Virginia Tech as well as several other schools. A fan of international movies, travel, and culture, the emergence of his own textbook and curriculum has given Boyer the opportunity to make the class truly his own.
I truly believe that this semester of World Regions has given me a much more in depth outlook on geopolitical interactions between different nation's on the world scale. With our world becoming increasingly globalized I believe that this information I have gained in the class will continue to benefit my worldview going forward.

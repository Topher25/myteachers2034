<h1>Comm 2084: Media and Society</h1>
<h2>Professor Mackay</h2>
<p>Media and Society is an intriguing class that teaches about the history of
the media in our world and the ever reaching effects that it has had on our
society. This includes subjects ranging from technological advances to cultural
influences from various people throughout the last several centuries. </p>
<p>Professor Mackay seems to truly enjoy teaching her communications classes
  over the years and is a big fan of her cats.</p>
  <p> This class has given me a lot of good information on how various current
  and past events and inventions have affected society today and gave me a
  greater grasp of how media affects and changes society.
